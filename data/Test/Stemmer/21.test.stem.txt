Effect
of
Usage-Bas
Feedback
on
Video
Retriev
:
A
Simulation-Bas
Studi
We
present
a
model
for
exploit
community-bas
usag
inform
for
video
retriev
,
where
implicit
usag
inform
from
past
user
is
exploit
in
order
to
provid
enhanc
assist
in
video
retriev
task
,
and
allevi
the
effect
of
the
semant
gap
problem
.
We
propos
a
graph-bas
model
for
all
type
of
implicit
and
explicit
feedback
,
in
which
the
relev
usag
inform
is
repres
.
Our
model
is
design
to
captur
the
complex
interact
of
a
user
with
an
interact
video
retriev
system
,
includ
the
represent
of
sequenc
of
user-system
interact
dure
a
search
session
.
Build
upon
thi
model
,
four
recommend
strategi
are
defin
and
evalu
.
An
evalu
strategi
is
propos
base
on
simul
user
action
,
which
enabl
the
evalu
of
our
recommend
strategi
over
a
usag
inform
pool
obtain
from
24
user
perform
four
differ
TRECVid
task
.
Furthermor
,
the
propos
simul
approach
is
use
to
simul
usag
inform
pool
with
differ
characterist
,
with
which
the
recommend
approach
are
further
evalu
on
a
larger
set
of
task
,
and
their

with

to
the
