in

A
spam
filter
is
an
autom
tool
to
recogn
spam
so
as
to
prevent
it
deliveri
.
The
purpos
of
spam
and
spam
filter
are
diametr
oppos
:
spam
is
effect
if
it
evad
filter
,
while
a
filter
is
effect
if
it
recogn
spam
.
The
circular
natur
of
these
definit
,
along
with
their
appeal
to
the
intent
of
sender
and
recipi
make
them
difficult
to
formal
.
A
typic
email
user
ha
a
work
definit
no
more
formal
than
"
I
know
it
when
I
see
it
.
"
Yet
,
current
spam
filter
are
remark
effect
,
more
effect
than
might
be
expect
given
the
level
of
uncertainti
and
debat
over
a
formal
definit
of
spam
,
more
effect
than
might
be
expect
given
the
state-of-the-art
inform
retriev
and
machin
learn
method
for
seemingli
similar
problem
.
But
are
they
effect
enough
?
Which
are
better
?
How
might
they
be
improv
?
Will
their
effect
be
compromis
by
more
cleverli
craft
spam
?
We
survey
current

propos
spam
filter
techniqu
with
particular
emphasi
on
how
well
they
work
.
Our
primari
focu
is

in

;
Similar
and
differ

such
as
instant

and
the

—
are

.
In
do
so
we
examin
the
definit
of

,
the
user'
inform
requir
and
the
role
of
the
spam
filter
as
one
compon
of
a
larg

Such

not

as

still

We
survey
these

their

and
their

.
In

of

mani

remain
