On-chip
hybrid
power
suppli
system
for
wireless
sensor
node
With
the
miniatur
of
electron
devic
,
small
size
but
high
capac
power
suppli
system
appear
to
be
more
and
more
import
.
A
hybrid
power
sourc
,
which
consist
of
a
fuel
cell
(
FC
)
and
a
recharg
batteri
,
ha
the
advantag
of
long
lifetim
and
good
load
follow
capabl
.
In
thi
paper
,
we
propos
the
schemat
of
a
hybrid
power
suppli
system
,
that
can
be
integr
on
a
chip
compat
with
present
CMO
process
.
Besid
,
consid
the
problem
of
maxim
the
on-chip
fuel
cell'
lifetim
,
we
propos
a
modifi
dynam
power
manag
(
DPM
)
algorithm
for
on-chip
fuel
cell
base
hybrid
power
system
in
wireless
sensor
node
design
.
Take
the
wireless
sensor
node
power
by
thi
hybrid
power
system
as
an
exampl
,
we
analyz
the
improv
of
the
FC-Bat
hybrid
power
system
.
The
simul
result
demonstr
that
the
on-chip
FC-Bat
hybrid
power
system
can
be
use
for
wireless
sensor
node
under
differ
usag
scenario
.
Meanwhil
,
for
an
on-chip
power
system
with
1cm2
area
consumpt
,
the
wafer-level
batteri
can
power
a
typic
sensor
node
for
onli
about
5
month
,
while
our
on-chip
hybrid
power
system
will
suppli
the
same
sensor
node
for
2
year
steadili
.
