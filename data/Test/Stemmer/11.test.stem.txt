An
effici
non-domin
sort
method
for
evolutionari
algorithm
We
present
a
new
non-domin
sort
algorithm
to
gener
the
non-domin
front
in
multi-object
optim
with
evolutionari
algorithm
,
particularli
the
NSGA-II
.
The
non-domin
sort
algorithm
use
by
NSGA-II
ha
a
time
complex
of
O
(
MN2
)
in
gener
non-domin
front
in
one
gener
(
iter
)
for
a
popul
size
N
and
M
object
function
.
Sinc
gener
non-domin
front
take
the
major
of
total
comput
time
(
exclud
the
cost
of
fit
evalu
)
of
NSGA-II
,
make
thi
algorithm
faster
will
significantli
improv
the
overal
effici
of
NSGA-II
and
other
genet
algorithm
use
non-domin
sort
.
The
new
non-domin
sort
algorithm
propos
in
thi
studi
reduc
the
number
of
redund
comparison
exist
in
the
algorithm
of
NSGA-II
by
record
the
domin
inform
among
solut
from
their
first
comparison
.
By
util
a
new
data
structur
call
the
domin
tree
and
the
divide-and-conqu
mechan
,
the
new
algorithm
is
faster
than
NSGA-II
for
differ
number
of
object
function
.
Although
the
number
of
solut
comparison
by
the
propos
algorithm
is
close
to
that
of
NSGA-II
when
the
number
of
object
becom
larg
,
the
total
comput
time
show
that
the
propos
algorithm
still
ha
better
effici
becaus
of
the
adopt
of
the
domin
tree
structur
and
the
divide-and-conqu
mechan
.
