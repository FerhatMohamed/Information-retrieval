The
B-and-
model
for
adapt
wormhol
rout
In
thi
paper
we
present
a
model
name
B-and-
(
Basic-and-Extend
)
that
can
be
conveni
use
to
design
adapt
rout
scheme
for
wormhol
rout
with
a
rel
low
cost
.
The
key
idea
is
to
divid
channel
into
two

group
:
basic
channel
that
are
respons
for
deadlock
freedom
,
and
extend
channel
that
are
in
charg
of
adapt
.
Appli
the

Model
to
the
well-known

topolog
,
we
construct
a

scheme
with
