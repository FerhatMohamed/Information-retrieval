Recommend

have
recent
grown
in
popular
both
in
e-commerc
and
in
research
.
Howev

sold

We
have
been
work
in
collabor

)
,
to
gather
real
evid
of
the

In
thi
paper
,
we
present
our
initi
evalu
of
the
perform
of
our
model-bas
personalis
recommend
system
over
the
21
-
month
period
from
May
2006
to
Januari
2008
,
with
particular
focu
on
the
added-valu
to
the
busi

Our
analysi
cover
shopper
penetr
,
as
well
as
the
direct
and
indirect
extra
revenu
gener
by
our
recommend
system
.
One
of
the
key
lesson
we
have
learnt
dure
thi
case
studi
is
that
the
effect
of
a
recommend
system
extend
far
beyond
the
direct
extra
revenu
gener
from
the
purchas
of
recommend
item
.
The
import
of

wa
also
found
to
be
key
to
maintain
the
perform
of
such
model-bas
system
.
