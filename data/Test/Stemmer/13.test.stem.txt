in

(
without

We
investig
the
design
of
algorithm
resili
to
memori
fault
,
i
.
e
.
,
algorithm
that
,
despit
the
corrupt

some
memori
valu
dure
their
execut
,
are
abl
to
produc
a
correct
output
on
the
set
of
uncorrupt
valu
.
In
thi
framework
,
we
consid
two
fundament
problem
:
sort
and
search
.
In
particular
,
we
prove
that
ani
O
(
nlog
n
)
comparison-bas
sort
algorithm
can
toler
at
most
O
(
(
nlog
n
)
1/2
)
memori
fault
.
Furthermor
,
we
present
one
comparison-bas
sort
algorithm
with
optim
space
and
run
time
that
is
resili
to
O
(
(
nlog

)
1/3
)
fault
.
We
also
prove
polylogarithm
lower
and
upper
bound
on
fault-toler
search
.
