Thi
paper
address
the
problem
of
how
to

without

,
which

Use
TREC
3
,
6
,
7
and
8
data
,
it
is
shown
how
the
overlap
structur
between
the
search
result
of
multipl
system
can
be
use
to
infer
rel
perform
differ
.
In
particular
,
the
overlap
structur
for
random
group
of
five
system
are
comput
,
so
that
each
system
is
select
an
equal
number
of
time
.
It
is
shown
that
the
averag
percentag
of
a
system'
document
that
are
onli
found
by
it
and
no
other
system
is
strongli
and
neg

such
as
it

The
present
method
use
the
degre
of

a

can
gener
to

qualiti
.
Thi
paper
also
address
the
question
of
how

list
need
to

to

.
It
is
shown
that
the
overlap
structur
of
the
top
50
document
can
be
use
to
rank
the
system
,
often
produc
the

The
