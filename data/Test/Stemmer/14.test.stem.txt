a
cache-oblivi
sort
algorithm
Thi
paper
is
an
algorithm
engin
studi
of
cache-oblivi
sort
.
We
investig
by
empir
method
a
number
of
implement
issu
and
paramet
choic
for
the
cache-oblivi
sort
algorithm
Lazi
Funnelsort
and
compar
the
final
algorithm
with
Quicksort
,
the
establish
standard
for
comparison-bas
sort
,
as
well
as
with
recent
cache-awar
propos
.
The
main
result
is
a
care
implement
cache-oblivi
sort
algorithm
,
which
,
our
experi
show
,
can
be
faster
than
the
best
Quicksort
implement
we
are
abl
to
find
for
input
size
well
within
the
limit
of
RAM
.
It
is
also
at
least
as
fast
as
the
recent
cache-awar
implement
includ
in
the
test
.
On
disk
,
the
differ
is
even
more
pronounc
regard
Quicksort
and
the
cache-awar
algorithm
,
wherea
the
algorithm
is
slower
than
a
care
implement
of
multiway
Mergesort
,
such
as
TPIE
.
