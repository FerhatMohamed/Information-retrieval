The
gener
class
of

consid
in
thi
paper
is
that
of
long-rang

.
The

From
an
analyt
viewpoint
,
a
physic
distribut
system
consist
of
sever
interact
activ
center
or
subsystem
among
which
tradeoff
in
cost
and
servic
exist
.
These
subsystem
are
often
refer
to
as
the
compon
of
a
physic
distribut
system
.
In
thi
research
the
classif
of
compon
includ
:
facil
network
,
inventori
alloc

and

With
the
except
of

,
these
compon
and
the
rel
rang
of
