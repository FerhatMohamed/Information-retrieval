An
efficient
non-dominated
sorting
method
for
evolutionary
algorithms
We
present
a
new
non-dominated
sorting
algorithm
to
generate
the
non-dominated
fronts
in
multi-objective
optimization
with
evolutionary
algorithms
,
particularly
the
NSGA-II
.
The
non-dominated
sorting
algorithm
used
by
NSGA-II
has
a
time
complexity
of
O
(
MN2
)
in
generating
non-dominated
fronts
in
one
generation
(
iteration
)
for
a
population
size
N
and
M
objective
functions
.
Since
generating
non-dominated
fronts
takes
the
majority
of
total
computational
time
(
excluding
the
cost
of
fitness
evaluations
)
of
NSGA-II
,
making
this
algorithm
faster
will
significantly
improve
the
overall
efficiency
of
NSGA-II
and
other
genetic
algorithms
using
non-dominated
sorting
.
The
new
non-dominated
sorting
algorithm
proposed
in
this
study
reduces
the
number
of
redundant
comparisons
existing
in
the
algorithm
of
NSGA-II
by
recording
the
dominance
information
among
solutions
from
their
first
comparisons
.
By
utilizing
a
new
data
structure
called
the
dominance
tree
and
the
divide-and-conquer
mechanism
,
the
new
algorithm
is
faster
than
NSGA-II
for
different
numbers
of
objective
functions
.
Although
the
number
of
solution
comparisons
by
the
proposed
algorithm
is
close
to
that
of
NSGA-II
when
the
number
of
objectives
becomes
large
,
the
total
computational
time
shows
that
the
proposed
algorithm
still
has
better
efficiency
because
of
the
adoption
of
the
dominance
tree
structure
and
the
divide-and-conquer
mechanism
.
