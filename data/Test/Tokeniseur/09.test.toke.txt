Dynamic
simulation

for

:
Discussion
of
the
computer
model
The
general
class
of
problem
considered
in
this
paper
is
that
of
long-range
planning
of
physical
distribution
systems
.
The
physical
distribution
activity
includes
design
and
administration
of
systems
to
control
raw
material
and
finished
goods
flow
from
manufacturing
source
to
point
of
consumption
.

From
an
analytical
viewpoint
,
a
physical
distribution
system
consists
of
several
interactive
activity
centers
or
subsystems
among
which
tradeoffs
in
cost
and
service
exist
.
These
subsystems
are
often
referred
to
as
the
components
of
a
physical
distribution
system
.
In
this
research
the
classification
of
components
includes
:
facility
network
,
inventory
allocations
,
communications
,
transportation
,
and
unitization
.
With
the
exception
of
unitization
,
these
components
and
the
relative
range
of
system
design
alternatives
are
familiar
to
the
reader
.
Unitization
,
in
a
broad
sense
,
involves
material
handling
,
packaging
,
and
containerization
.
