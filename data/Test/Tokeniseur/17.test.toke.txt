The
value
of
personalised
recommender
systems
to
e-business
:
a
case
study
Recommender
systems
have
recently
grown
in
popularity
both
in
e-commerce
and
in
research
.
However
,
there
is
little
,
if
any
,
direct
evidence
in
the
literature
of
the
value
of
recommender
systems
to
e-Businesses
,
especially
relating
to
consumer
packaged
goods
(
CPG
)
sold
in
a
supermarket
setting
.
We
have
been
working
in
collaboration
with
LeShop
(
www.LeShop.ch
)
,
to
gather
real
evidence
of
the
added
business
value
of
a
personalised
recommender
system
.
In
this
paper
,
we
present
our
initial
evaluation
of
the
performance
of
our
model-based
personalised
recommender
systems
over
the
21
-
month
period
from
May
2006
to
January
2008
,
with
particular
focus
on
the
added-value
to
the
business
.
Our
analysis
covers
shopper
penetration
,
as
well
as
the
direct
and
indirect
extra
revenue
generated
by
our
recommender
systems
.
One
of
the
key
lessons
we
have
learnt
during
this
case
study
is
that
the
effect
of
a
recommender
system
extends
far
beyond
the
direct
extra
revenue
generated
from
the
purchase
of
recommended
items
.
The
importance
of
maintaining
updated
model
files
was
also
found
to
be
key
to
maintaining
the
performance
of
such
model-based
systems
.
