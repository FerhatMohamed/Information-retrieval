Prototyping
recommender
systems
in
jcolibri
Our
goal
is
to
support
system
developers
in
rapid
prototyping
recommender
systems
using
Case-Based
Reasoning
(
CBR
)
techniques
.
In
this
paper
we
describe
how
jCOLIBRI
can
serve
to
that
goal
.
jCOLIBRI
is
an
object-oriented
framework
in
Java
for
building
CBR
systems
that
greatly
benefits
from
the
reuse
of
previously
developed
CBR
systems
.
jCOLIBRI
includes
a
case
base
of
templates
for
case-based
recommender
systems
that
can
be
easily
adapted
to
prototype
a
great
variety
of
alternatives
.
We
describe
the
contents
of
the
case
base
and
show
experimental
results
from
our
experience
using
the
recommender
templates
case
base
with
mid-size
projects
from
undergraduate
students
.
