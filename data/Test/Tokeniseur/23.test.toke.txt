The
task-dependent
effect
of
tags
and
ratings
on
social
media
access
Recently
,
online
social
networks
have
emerged
that
allow
people
to
share
their
multimedia
files
,
retrieve
interesting
content
,
and
discover
like-minded
people
.
These
systems
often
provide
the
possibility
to
annotate
the
content
with
tags
and
ratings
.
Using
a
random
walk
through
the
social
annotation
graph
,
we
have
combined
these
annotations
into
a
retrieval
model
that
effectively
balances
the
personal
preferences
and
opinions
of
like-minded
users
into
a
single
relevance
ranking
for
either
content
,
tags
,
or
people
.
We
use
this
model
to
identify
the
influence
of
different
annotation
methods
and
system
design
aspects
on
common
ranking
tasks
in
social
content
systems
.
Our
results
show
that
a
combination
of
rating
and
tagging
information
can
improve
tasks
like
search
and
recommendation
.
The
optimal
influence
of
both
sources
on
the
ranking
is
highly
dependent
on
the
retrieval
task
and
system
design
.
Results
on
content
search
and
tag
suggestion
indicate
that
the
profile
created
by
a
user's
annotations
can
be
used
effectively
to
adapt
the
ranking
to
personal
preferences
.
The
random
walk
reduces
sparsity
problems
by
smoothly
integrating
indirectly
related
concepts
in
the
relevance
ranking
,
which
is
especially
valuable
for
cold-start
users
or
individual
tagging
systems
like
YouTube
and
Flickr
.
