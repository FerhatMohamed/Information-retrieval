Using
the
structure
of
overlap
between
search
results
to
rank
retrieval
systems
without
relevance
judgments
This
paper
addresses
the
problem
of
how
to
rank
retrieval
systems
without
the
need
for
human
relevance
judgments
,
which
are
very
resource
intensive
to
obtain
.
Using
TREC
3
,
6
,
7
and
8
data
,
it
is
shown
how
the
overlap
structure
between
the
search
results
of
multiple
systems
can
be
used
to
infer
relative
performance
differences
.
In
particular
,
the
overlap
structures
for
random
groupings
of
five
systems
are
computed
,
so
that
each
system
is
selected
an
equal
number
of
times
.
It
is
shown
that
the
average
percentage
of
a
system's
documents
that
are
only
found
by
it
and
no
other
systems
is
strongly
and
negatively
correlated
with
its
retrieval
performance
effectiveness
,
such
as
its
mean
average
precision
or
precision
at
1000
.
The
presented
method
uses
the
degree
of
consensus
or
agreement
a
retrieval
system
can
generate
to
infer
its
quality
.
This
paper
also
addresses
the
question
of
how
many
documents
in
a
ranked
list
need
to
be
examined
to
be
able
to
rank
the
systems
.
It
is
shown
that
the
overlap
structure
of
the
top
50
documents
can
be
used
to
rank
the
systems
,
often
producing
the
best
results
.
The
presented
method
significantly
improves
upon
previous
attempts
to
rank
retrieval
systems
without
the
need
for
human
relevance
judgments
.
This
'
'
structure
of
overlap
'
'
method
can
be
of
value
to
communities
that
need
to
identify
the
best
experts
or
rank
them
,
but
do
not
have
the
resources
to
evaluate
the
experts
'
recommendations
,
since
it
does
not
require
knowledge
about
the
domain
being
searched
or
the
information
being
requested
.
