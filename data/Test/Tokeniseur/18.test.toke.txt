UTA-Rec
:
a
recommender
system
based
on
multiple
criteria
analysis
UTARec
,
a
Recommender
System
that
incorporates
Multiple
Criteria
Analysis
methodologies
is
presented
.
The
system's
performance
and
capability
of
addressing
certain
shortfalls
of
existing
Recommender
Systems
is
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
movie
recommendations
.
UTARec's
accuracy
is
measured
in
terms
of
Kendall's
tau
and
ROC
curve
analysis
and
is
also
compared
to
a
Multiple
Rating
Collaborative
Filtering
(
MRCF
)
approach
.
The
results
indicate
that
the
proposed
Multiple
Criteria
Analysis
methodology
can
certainly
improve
the
recommendation
process
by
producing
highly
accurate
results
,
from
a
user
oriented
perspective
.
