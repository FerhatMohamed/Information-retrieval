The
B-and-E
model
for
adaptive
wormhole
routing
In
this
paper
we
present
a
model
named
B-and-E
(
Basic-and-Extended
)
that
can
be
conveniently
used
to
design
adaptable
routing
schemes
for
wormhole
routing
with
a
relatively
low
cost
.
The
key
idea
is
to
divide
channels
into
two
separate
groups
:
basic
channels
that
are
responsible
for
deadlock
freedom
,
and
extended
channels
that
are
in
charge
of
adaptability
.
Applying
the
B-visibility
:
visible
;
color
:
r-E
Model
to
the
well-known
k-ary
n-cube
mesh
topology
,
we
construct
a
fully
adaptable
routing
scheme
with
only
two
virtual
channels
sharing
one
physical
channel
.
The
simulation
results
demonstrate
that
,
with
respect
to
communication
throughput
and
transfer
latency
,
the
new
routing
scheme
indeed
provides
a
superior
performance
.
To
explore
the
routing
flexibility
more
efficiently
,
a
heuristic
policy
called
2
-
Step
Scoreboard
is
introduced
,
resulting
in
a
further
improvement
.
