On
enhancing
the
performance
of
spam
mail
filtering
system
using
semantic
enrichment
With
the
explosive
growth
of
the
Internet
,
e-mails
are
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
important
methods
to
send
e-mails
as
a
substitute
for
traditional
communications
As
e-mail
has
become
a
major
mean
of
communication
in
the
Internet
age
,
exponentially
growing
spam
mails
have
been
raised
as
a
main
problem
As
a
result
of
this
problem
,
researchers
have
suggested
many
methodologies
to
solve
it
Especially
,
Bayesian
classifier-based
systems
show
high
performances
to
filter
spam
mail
and
many
commercial
products
available
However
,
they
have
several
problems
First
,
it
has
a
cold
start
problem
,
that
is
,
training
phase
has
to
be
done
before
execution
of
the
system
The
system
must
be
trained
about
spam
and
non-spam
mail
Second
,
its
cost
for
filtering
spam
mail
is
higher
than
rule-based
systems
Last
problem
,
we
focus
on
,
is
that
the
filtering
performance
is
decreased
when
E-mail
has
only
a
few
terms
which
represent
its
contents
To
solve
this
problem
,
we
suggest
spam
mail
filtering
system
using
concept
indexing
and
Semantic
Enrichment
For
the
performance
evaluation
,
we
compare
our
experimental
results
with
those
of
Bayesian
classifier
which
is
widely
used
in
spam
mail
filtering
The
experimental
result
shows
that
the
proposed
system
has
improved
performance
in
comparison
with
Bayesian
classifier
respectively
.
