Detecting
and
filtering
instant
messaging
spam
:
a
global
and
personalized
approach
While
Instant
Message
(
IM
)
is
gaining
its
popularity
it
is
exposed
to
increasingly
severe
security
threats
.
A
serious
problem
is
IM
spam
(
spim
)
that
is
unsolicited
commercial
messages
sent
via
IM
messengers
.
Unlike
email
spam
(
unsolicited
bulk
e-mails
)
,
which
has
been
a
serious
security
issue
for
a
long
time
and
a
number
of
techniques
have
been
proposed
to
cope
with
,
spim
has
not
received
adequate
attention
from
the
research
community
yet
,
and
traditional
spam
filtering
techniques
are
not
directly
applicable
to
spim
due
to
its
presence
information
and
real
time
nature
.
In
this
paper
,
we
present
a
new
architecture
for
detecting
and
filtering
spim
.
With
the
unique
infrastructure
of
IM
systems
spim
detection
and
filtering
can
be
achieved
not
only
at
the
client
(
receiver
)
side
-
for
a
personalized
filtering
-
but
also
at
the
server
side
and
various
IM
gateways
-
for
a
global
filtering
.
Our
technique
integrates
a
number
of
mature
spam
defending
techniques
with
modifications
for
IM
applications
,
such
as
Black
/
White
List
,
collaborative
feedback
based
filtering
,
content-based
technique
,
and
challenge-response
based
filtering
.
We
also
design
and
implement
new
techniques
for
efficient
spim
detection
and
filtering
,
including
filtering
methods
based
on
IM
sending
rate
,
content
based
spim
defending
techniques
,
fingerprint
vector
based
filtering
,
text
comparison
filtering
,
and
Bayesian
filtering
.
We
provide
an
analysis
of
their
performances
based
on
experimental
results
.
