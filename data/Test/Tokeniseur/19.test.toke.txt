CNS
:
a
new
energy
efficient
transmission
scheme
for
wireless
sensor
networks
We
present
in
this
paper
a
new
energy-efficient
communication
scheme
called
CNS
(
Compression
with
Null
Symbol
)
that
combines
the
power
of
data
compression
and
communication
through
silent
symbol
.
The
concept
of
communication
through
silent
symbol
is
borrowed
from
the
energy
efficient
schemes
proposed
in
Sinha

We
show
that
the
average
theoretical
energy
saving
at
the
transmitter
by
CNS
is
62.5
%
,
assuming
an
ideal
channel
and
for
equal
likelihood
of
all
possible
binary
strings
of
a
given
length
.
Next
,
we
propose
a
transceiver
design
that
uses
a
hybrid
modulation
scheme
utilizing
FSK
and
ASK
so
as
to
keep
the
cost
/
complexity
of
the
radio
devices
low
.
Considering
an
additive
white
gaussian
noise
(
AWGN
)
channel
and
a
non-coherent
detection
based
receiver
,
CNS
shows
a
saving
in
transmitter
energy
by
30
%
when
compared
to
binary
FSK
,
for
equal
likelihood
of
all
possible
binary
strings
of
a
given
length
.
Simultaneously
,
there
is
a
saving
of
50
%
at
the
receiver
for
all
types
of
data
modulation
due
to
halving
of
the
transmitted
data
duration
,
compared
to
binary
encoding
.

average
transmitter
energy
savings
of

respectively
.
Also
,
at
the
receiver
side
,
while
RBNSiZeComm
does
not
generate
any
saving
,
TSS
and
RZE
produce
about
36.9
and
12.5
%
savings
on
an
average
,
respectively

,
our

demonstrate
that

the

vary
from

for

this

Thus
,
taking
into
account
the
low
cost
/
complexity
of
the
proposed
transceiver
,
these
results
clearly
establish
that
CNS
can
be
a
suitable
candidate
for
communication
in
low
power
wireless
sensor
networks
,
such
as
in
remote

applications
,
body

,

,

and
many
others
