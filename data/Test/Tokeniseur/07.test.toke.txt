Clustering
ensemble
for
spam
filtering
One
of
the
main
problems
that
modern
e-mail
systems
face
is
the
management
of
the
high
degree
of
spam
or
junk
mail
they
recieve
.
Those
systems
are
expected
to
be
able
to
distinguish
between
legitimate
mail
and
spam
;
in
order
to
present
the
final
user
as
much
interesting
information
as
possible
.
This
study
presents
a
novel
hybrid
intelligent
system
using
both
unsupervised
and
supervised
learning
that
can
be
easily
adapted
to
be
used
in
an
individual
or
collaborative
system
.
The
system
divides
the
spam
filtering
problem
into
two
stages
:
firstly
it
divides
the
input
data
space
into
different
similar
parts
.
Then
it
generates
several
simple
classifiers
that
are
used
to
classify
correctly
messages
that
are
contained
in
one
of
the
parts
previously
determined
.
That
way
the
efficiency
of
each
classifier
increases
,
as
they
can
specialize
in
separate
the
spam
from
certain
types
of
related
messages
.
The
hybrid
system
presented
has
been
tested
with
a
real
e-mail
data
base
and
a
comparison
of
its
results
with
those
obtained
from
other
common
classification
methods
is
also
included
.
This
novel
hybrid
technique
proves
to
be
effective
in
the
problem
under
study
.
