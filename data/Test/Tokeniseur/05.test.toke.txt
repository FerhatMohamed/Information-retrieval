new
collection
and

The
growth
of
mobile
phone
users
has
lead
to
a
dramatic
increasing
of
SMS
spam
messages
.
In
practice
,
fighting
mobile
phone
spam
is
difficult
by
several
factors
,
including
the
lower
rate
of
SMS
that
has
allowed
many
users
and
service
providers
to
ignore
the
issue
,
and
the
limited
availability
of
mobile
phone
spam-filtering
software
.
On
the
other
hand
,
in
academic
settings
,
a
major
handicap
is
the
scarcity
of
public
SMS
spam
datasets
,
that
are
sorely
needed
for
validation
and
comparison
of
different
classifiers
.
Moreover
,
as
SMS
messages
are
fairly
short
,
content-based
spam
filters
may
have
their
performance
degraded
.
In
this
paper
,
we
offer
a
new
real
,
public
and
non-encoded
SMS
spam
collection
that
is
the
largest
one
as
far
as
we
know
.
Moreover
,
we
compare
the
performance
achieved
by
several
established
machine
learning
methods
.
The
results
indicate
that
Support
Vector
Machine
outperforms
other
evaluated
classifiers
and
,
hence
,
it
can
be
used
as
a
good
baseline
for
further
comparison
.
