Generic
discrimination
:
sorting
and
paritioning
unshared
data
in
linear
time
We
introduce
the
notion
of
discrimination
as
a
generalization
of
both
sorting
and
partitioning
and
show
that
worst-case
linear-time
discrimination
functions
(
discriminators
)
can
be
defined
generically
,
by
(
co
-
)
induction
on
an
expressive
language
of
order
denotations
.
The
generic
definition
yields
discriminators
that
generalize
both
distributive
sorting
and
multiset
discrimination
.
The
generic
discriminator
can
be
coded
compactly
using
list
comprehensions
,
with
order
denotations
specified
using
Generalized
Algebraic
Data
Types
(
GADTs
)
.
A
GADT-free
combinator
formulation
of
discriminators
is
also
given
.
We
give
some
examples
of
the
uses
of
discriminators
,
including
a
new
most-significant-digit
lexicographic
sorting
algorithm
.
Discriminators
generalize
binary
comparison
functions
:
They
operate
on
n
arguments
at
a
time
,
but
do
not
expose
more
information
than
the
underlying
equivalence
,
respectively
ordering
relation
on
the
arguments
.
We
argue
that
primitive
types
with
equality
(
such
as
references
in
ML
)
and
ordered
types
(
such
as
the
machine
integer
type
)
,
should
expose
their
equality
,
respectively
standard
ordering
relation
,
as
discriminators
:
Having
only
a
binary
equality
test
on
a
type
requires
T
(
n2
)
time
to
find
all
the
occurrences
of
an
element
in
a
list
of
length
n
,
for
each
element
in
the
list
,
even
if
the
equality
test
takes
only
constant
time
.
A
discriminator
accomplishes
this
in
linear
time
.
Likewise
,
having
only
a
(
constant-time
)
comparison
function
requires
T
(
n
log
n
)
time
to
sort
a
list
of
n
elements
.
A
discriminator
can
do
this
in
linear
time
.
