On-chip
hybrid
power
supply
system
for
wireless
sensor
nodes
With
the
miniaturization
of
electronic
devices
,
small
size
but
high
capacity
power
supply
system
appears
to
be
more
and
more
important
.
A
hybrid
power
source
,
which
consists
of
a
fuel
cell
(
FC
)
and
a
rechargeable
battery
,
has
the
advantages
of
long
lifetime
and
good
load
following
capabilities
.
In
this
paper
,
we
propose
the
schematic
of
a
hybrid
power
supply
system
,
that
can
be
integrated
on
a
chip
compatible
with
present
CMOS
process
.
Besides
,
considering
the
problem
of
maximizing
the
on-chip
fuel
cell's
lifetime
,
we
propose
a
modified
dynamic
power
management
(
DPM
)
algorithm
for
on-chip
fuel
cell
based
hybrid
power
system
in
wireless
sensor
node
design
.
Taking
the
wireless
sensor
node
powered
by
this
hybrid
power
system
as
an
example
,
we
analyze
the
improvement
of
the
FC-Bat
hybrid
power
system
.
The
simulation
results
demonstrate
that
the
on-chip
FC-Bat
hybrid
power
system
can
be
used
for
wireless
sensor
node
under
different
usage
scenarios
.
Meanwhile
,
for
an
on-chip
power
system
with
1cm2
area
consumption
,
the
wafer-level
battery
can
power
a
typical
sensor
node
for
only
about
5
months
,
while
our
on-chip
hybrid
power
system
will
supply
the
same
sensor
node
for
2
years
steadily
.
