Enhancing
scalability
in
anomaly-based
email
spam
filtering
Spam
has
become
an
important
problem
for
computer
security
because
it
is
a
channel
for
the
spreading
of
threats
such
as
computer
viruses
,
worms
and
phishing
.
Currently
,
more
than
85
%
of
received
emails
are
spam
.
Historical
approaches
to
combat
these
messages
,
including
simple
techniques
such
as
sender
blacklisting
or
the
use
of
email
signatures
,
are
no
longer
completely
reliable
.
Many
solutions
utilise
machine-learning
approaches
trained
using
statistical
representations
of
the
terms
that
usually
appear
in
the
emails
.
However
,
these
methods
require
a
time-consuming
training
step
with
labelled
data
.
Dealing
with
the
situation
where
the
availability
of
labelled
training
instances
is
limited
slows
down
the
progress
of
filtering
systems
and
offers
advantages
to
spammers
.
In
a
previous
work
,
we
presented
the
first
spam
filtering
method
based
on
anomaly
detection
that
reduces
the
necessity
of
labelling
spam
messages
and
only
employs
the
representation
of
legitimate
emails
.
We
showed
that
this
method
achieved
high
accuracy
rates
detecting
spam
while
maintaining
a
low
false
positive
rate
and
reducing
the
effort
produced
by
labelling
spam
.
In
this
paper
,
we
enhance
that
system
applying
a
data
reduction
algorithm
to
the
labelled
dataset
,
finding
similarities
among
legitimate
emails
and
grouping
them
to
form
consistent
clusters
that
reduce
the
amount
of
needed
comparisons
.
We
show
that
this
improvement
reduces
drastically
the
processing
time
,
while
maintaining
detection
and
false
positive
rates
stable
.
