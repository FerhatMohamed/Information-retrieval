Recommender
Systems
Research
:
A
Connection-Centric
Survey
Recommender
systems
attempt
to
reduce
information
overload
and
retain
customers
by
selecting
a
subset
of
items
from
a
universal
set
based
on
user
preferences
.
While
research
in
recommender
systems
grew
out
of
information
retrieval
and
filtering
,
the
topic
has
steadily
advanced
into
a
legitimate
and
challenging
research
area
of
its
own
.
Recommender
systems
have
traditionally
been
studied
from
a
content-based
filtering
vs
.
collaborative
design
perspective
.
Recommendations
,
however
,
are
not
delivered
within
a
vacuum
,
but
rather
cast
within
an
informal
community
of
users
and
social
context
.
Therefore
,
ultimately
all
recommender
systems
make
connections
among
people
and
thus
should
be
surveyed
from
such
a
perspective
.
This
viewpoint
is
under-emphasized
in
the
recommender
systems
literature
.
We
therefore
take
a
connection-oriented
perspective
toward
recommender
systems
research
.
We
posit
that
recommendation
has
an
inherently
social
element
and
is
ultimately
intended
to
connect
people
either
directly
as
a
result
of
explicit
user
modeling
or
indirectly
through
the
discovery
of
relationships
implicit
in
extant
data
.
Thus
,
recommender
systems
are
characterized
by
how
they
model
users
to
bring
people
together
:
explicitly
or
implicitly
.
Finally
,
user
modeling
and
the
connection-centric
viewpoint
raise
broadening
and
social
issues
—
such
as
evaluation
,
targeting
,
and
privacy
and
trust
—
which
we
also
briefly
address
.
