The
B-and-E
model
adaptive
wormhole
routing
In
paper
present
model
named
B-and-E
(
Basic-and-Extended
)
conveniently
used
design
adaptable
routing
schemes
wormhole
routing
relatively
low

.
The
key
idea
divide
channels
two
separate
groups
:
basic
channels
responsible
deadlock
freedom
,
extended
channels
charge
adaptability
.

Model
well-known

,
construct
fully
adaptable
routing
scheme
two
virtual
channels
sharing
one
physical
channel
.
The

,
new

indeed
provides
superior

.
To
explore
