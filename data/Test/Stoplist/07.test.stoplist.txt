Clustering
ensemble
spam
filtering
One
main
problems
modern
e-mail
systems
face
management
high
degree
spam
junk
mail
recieve
.
Those
systems
expected
able
distinguish
legitimate
mail
spam
;
order
present
final
user
much
interesting
information
possible
.
This
study
presents
novel
hybrid
intelligent
system
using
unsupervised
supervised
learning
easily
adapted
used
individual
collaborative
system
.
The
system
divides
spam
filtering
problem
two
stages
:
firstly
divides
input
data
space
different
similar
parts
.
Then
generates
several
simple
classifiers
used
classify
correctly
messages
contained
one
parts
previously
determined
.
That
way
efficiency
classifier
increases
,
specialize
separate
spam
certain
types
related
messages
.
The
hybrid
system
presented
tested
real
e-mail
data
base
comparison
results
obtained
common
classification
methods
also
included
.
This
novel
hybrid
technique
proves
effective
problem
study
.
