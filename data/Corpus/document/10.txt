The B-and-E model for adaptive wormhole routing
In this paper we present a model named B-and-E (Basic-and-Extended) that can be conveniently used to design adaptable routing schemes for wormhole routing with a relatively low cost. The key idea is to divide channels into two separate groups: basic channels that are responsible for deadlock freedom, and extended channels that are in charge of adaptability. Applying the B-visibility:visible;  color: r-E Model to the well-known k-ary n-cube mesh topology, we construct a fully adaptable routing scheme with only two virtual channels sharing one physical channel. The simulation results demonstrate that, with respect to communication throughput and transfer latency, the new routing scheme indeed provides a superior performance. To explore the routing flexibility more efficiently, a heuristic policy called 2-Step Scoreboard is introduced, resulting in a further improvement.
