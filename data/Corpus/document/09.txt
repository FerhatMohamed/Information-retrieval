Dynamic simulation model for planning physical distribution systems: Discussion of the computer model
The general class of problem considered in this paper is that of long-range planning of physical distribution systems. The physical distribution activity includes design and administration of systems to control raw material and finished goods flow from manufacturing source to point of consumption.2 From an analytical viewpoint, a physical distribution system consists of several interactive activity centers or subsystems among which tradeoffs in cost and service exist. These subsystems are often referred to as the components of a physical distribution system. In this research the classification of components includes: facility network, inventory allocations, communications, transportation, and unitization. With the exception of unitization, these components and the relative range of system design alternatives are familiar to the reader. Unitization, in a broad sense, involves material handling, packaging, and containerization.
