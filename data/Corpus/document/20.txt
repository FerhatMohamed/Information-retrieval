Software engineers' information behaviour and implicit relevance indicators
Software engineering is a cognitively challenging process that requires continuous access to multiple sources of information. As a consequence Software Engineers spend a significant proportion of time (20-30%) searching for information and engaging in opportunistic programming practices, reusing the existing software elements. In this paper, we summarise the findings, discussing how software developers interact with information and information retrieval systems. Importantly we investigate to what extent a domain-specific search and recommendation system can be delivered in order to support their daily activities. Based on two user studies, a questionnaire and an automated observation of user interactions with the browser, we identify that software engineers engage in a finite number of work-related tasks and also develop a finite number of 'work practices'/'archetypes of behaviour'. Secondly we identify a group of domain-specific behaviours that can successfully be used for relevance feedback of a domain-specific and semi-collaborative information recommendation system that can support software engineers in performing their daily work-related tasks more effectively.
