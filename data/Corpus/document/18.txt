UTA-Rec: a recommender system based on multiple criteria analysis
UTARec, a Recommender System that incorporates Multiple Criteria Analysis methodologies is presented. The system's performance and capability of addressing certain shortfalls of existing Recommender Systems is demonstrated in the case of movie recommendations. UTARec's accuracy is measured in terms of Kendall's tau and ROC curve analysis and is also compared to a Multiple Rating Collaborative Filtering (MRCF) approach. The results indicate that the proposed Multiple Criteria Analysis methodology can certainly improve the recommendation process by producing highly accurate results, from a user oriented perspective.
